# Project 12 - SportSee Sports Analysis Application Dashboard

This frontend project is connected to a backend API service that you also need to run locally.

The backend project can be found here: https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard

## Prerequisites:

- [NodeJS (**version 12.18**)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Step 1 - Launch the backend

Follow the instructions in the README of the backend project.

### Step 2 - Launch the frontend

- Clone the repo and run the command: `$ cd sportsee`
- Install the npm packages (described in package.json): `$ npm install`
- Launch the application: `$ npm start`
- Open http://localhost:3001 to view it in your browser. (here we use localhost:3001 for the frontend because the backend is already on the localhost:3000)

**Warning, currently only two users have been mocked. They have userId 12 and 18 respectively.**
